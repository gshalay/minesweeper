# Minesweeper

This is a simple Minesweeper game that contains both a CLI and UI version.

## Install:

Source can be copied by git cloning the repositiory found here: https://github.com/gshalay/minesweeper, or by directly downloading the source as a zip.

Once downloaded or cloned, run the command "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt" to install all necessary packages for the program.

If running on windows, you'll need to install the custom font called Techonology-Bold.ttf located at minesweeper/assets/Techonology-Bold.ttf. This can just be done by double-clicking the .ttf file. Windows should handle the rest.


## Running the Application:

There are a few different ways to run the application:
1. Running launch_ui.sh directly to run the UI version.
2. Running launch_cli.sh directly to run the CLI version.
3. Run launch.py with command-line arg -u for UI or -c for the CLI version. (e.g. python ./launch.py <-u or -c>)
